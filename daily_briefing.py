"""
daily_briefing.py — background email delivery: due reminders + weekly
calendar summary.

MULTI-USER BUILD: proactive notifications can't reuse the live SSE stream
(event_stream.py) the way a single-tenant assistant would — SSE only
reaches a browser tab that happens to be open right now, and by definition
these fire when nobody's necessarily looking at the HUD. Delivered as real
email instead, sent through each user's own Gmail connection
(google_service.send_email), which reaches them whether or not the HUD is
open. This replaces the old single-account version, which pushed one
global agenda over SSE to every connected tab — meaningless once there's
more than one user's calendar involved, and it never actually ran in
production anyway (see start_scheduler's old docstring / git history):
it was only ever started from the `if __name__ == "__main__"` block, which
gunicorn (Render's `gunicorn app:app`) never executes.

One background thread, checked once a minute:
  - reminders: any due (users.get_due_reminders), emailed and marked
    delivered.
  - weekly summary: once a week (JARVIS_WEEKLY_SUMMARY_WEEKDAY/HOUR/MINUTE,
    default Sunday 08:00 local), emailed to every currently-connected user
    (users.list_connected_user_ids) — their own week ahead.

Same free-tier caveat as users.py's docstring: users.db is wiped on every
restart/spin-down, so a reminder set for later can silently vanish if the
server recycles before it fires. Real persistence needs a durable store
(e.g. Render's free Postgres), not this ephemeral SQLite file — worth
knowing before relying on this for anything time-critical.
